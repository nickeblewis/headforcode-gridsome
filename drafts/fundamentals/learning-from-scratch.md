Some of the hardest questions I am often asked, go along the lines of; "Where do I start? What language do you recommend? What industry should I go into?" and so on. Let me begin to answer this by posing a few pointers that may help.

- Just start! Sounds daft but as with most things, just get cracking on your learning path. You know you want to learn and that's a good enough place to start - Willingness to learn!
- Take a course: This depends on how much you are willing to spend and whichever course you do, ensure that you complete it before moving on, especially with online learning. I say this because it's easy to get distracted with everything online!
- Get really good at what you learn by following the tutorial once as guided and then do it again but adapt the lessons to help you build something of your own. I've done this ever since the start. You can use tutorials as templates for your very own projects. You will be amazed at how effective this can be.

## Which language shall we start with?

Short answer = JavaScript!

HeadForCode is written with VueJS which is a framework for JavaScript and is complemented by HTML, CSS, Markdown and an API powered back-end which is a mixture of React and NodeJS. However if you are a new programmer, it's best to slow yourself down, take a deep breath and consider learning JavaScript (JS) independently. It will make a difference to your coding and how you understand the language itself. I must confess when I first learnt JS, that I approached it from the jQuery angle which was wrong in many ways. I guess many people were the same, especially if like me you came from a .NET/C# back-end programming background.

I will cover other languages in the future also but let's begin with JS for the moment, it is powerful and is quite literally everywhere!

### In the future I'll cover

- Python
- C#
- Dart (quite a new one but I really love it)
- PHP

## JavaScript Fundamentals

Before I delve into what JavaScript is, let's have a look at what programming (or coding) is itself and some of the principles that we will learn over time.

### What is an algorithm?

> A programming algorithm is a computer procedure that is a lot like a recipe (called a procedure) and tells your computer precisely what steps to take to solve a problem or reach a goal. The ingredients are called inputs, while the results are called the outputs. The number of steps are finite.

Programming itself has evolved since the more simple days of computing but fundamentally the above statement is as true as it ever has been. It is the role of the programmer to interpret the goal and translate it into a language that the machine understands and can replicate x number of times again in the future. This is where the programming language comes into the equation.

### What is JavaScript exactly?

We will address the above requirements using a programming language of some description and for the benefit of this article and most of this website, JavaScript is the chosen one. However what is JavaScript and what sets it apart from rival languages. Why would we choose it over the myriad of other options available to us?

Let me share a definition taken from Mozilla, who along with Brendan Eich were the organisation behind JavaScript:

> JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS)...

Traditionally JS was just a client based scripting language that would operate within your web browser, which is now only partly the case because courtesy of NodeJS, you can use JS to build server side applications too! So as we shall see, full-stack applications can be built entirely in JS!!
