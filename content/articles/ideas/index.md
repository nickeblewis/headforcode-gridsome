I am looking for some help from the wider community out there to implement some of these ideas but of course I will tackle them myself to work them through:

- Hook up Sanity to headforcode and document it
- Raspberry Pi experiments
- Use Sanity in conjunction with Alexa Skills
- Squizzy and how it could be put to good use right now for fun
