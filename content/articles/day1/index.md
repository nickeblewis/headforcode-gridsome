> NOTE: This article was written during the Covid-19 crisis of the year 2020. If you are reading this in the future, well done for staying safe and surviving. If you are reading this now, good luck and here is a series that I hope will keep you amused, as well as myself the author of it!!

Are you stuck at home for awhile? As a kidney transplant patient, I am at high risk of developing a serious illness if I did pick up Covid-19. So I have been advised to stay home for 12 weeks much like a lot of other people have been. I am lucky that for the most part I do a lot of remote contract work but things are quiet right now. So I decided to brush up on a few skills I've not touched in ages or even learn some new stuff along the way. It will help fill the time. Luckily we have a garden I can enjoy for some fresh air and exercise. I am considering running a solo park-run event around the garden, perhaps attempting a Guinness Book of Records entry. 

Back to the code and the reality of things.

## The plan for today's experiment
- Find some good data out there that is served up via a public API. 
- Hook this up to our Gridsome powered website
- Display the data in Gridsome in some useful kind of way

## Getting up and running quickly

You can in fact get up and running really fast by heading over to Gridsome's website and following the steps to create a simple website or better still you can clone this website for a super smooth quick start. It quite literally is this website although some features may not work but it is a perfect learning tool for you and I. Let's go...
